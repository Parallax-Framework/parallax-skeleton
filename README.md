# Parallax Skeleton Schema

The Skeleton Schema is the foundational schema for the Parallax framework. It provides a clean, minimal base for developing new gamemodes, schemas, or roleplaying experiences using the Parallax modular structure.

## üöß Purpose

This schema exists to:

- Serve as a starting point for custom schemas
- Demonstrate Parallax's schema structure and conventions
